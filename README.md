	# MERN Stack To-Do List App
.	
	Welcome to Mikals todo list of  MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack To-Do list application! This project demonstrates the creation of a simple yet effective To-Do list using modern web development technologies.
	
	## Project Overview
	
	### 1. Backend Setup (Node.js, Express, MongoDB):
   - **Project Initialization:**
	     - First I Set up a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
	     - then Install necessary dependencies, such as Express for the server and Mongoose for MongoDB interaction.
	
	   - **Database Configuration:**
	     - I Set up a MongoDB database using a service like MongoDB Atlas or a local instance.
	     - I  Define a schema for the To-Do items and use Mongoose to interact with the database.
	
	   - **API Routes:**
	     - I Create Express routes for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) related to To-Do items.
	
	### 2. Frontend Setup (React):
	   - **Create React App:**
	     - I Use `create-react-app` or another method to set up a new React application.
	
	   - **Component Structure:**
	     -I  Create React components for the main application, To-Do list, and individual To-Do items.
	
	   - **State Management:**
	     - I  Use React state to manage the application's state, including the list of To-Do items.
	
	   - **API Integration:**
	     - I Connect the React frontend to the Express backend using `fetch` or Axios to perform CRUD operations.
	
	   - **User Interface:**
	     - I Design a user-friendly interface for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting To-Do items.
	
	### 3. Integration (Connecting Frontend and Backend):
	   -I  Ensure that the React frontend communicates effectively with the Express backend.
	   -Then Set up CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
